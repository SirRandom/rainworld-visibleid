# Visible ID
This git repository contains the C# source code for the Visible ID mod originally authored by ratrat44. The code has been ported to Rain World v1.9 and iterated upon by fish.

Major features include viewing creatures' entity IDs, their personalities, and the ability to name creatures via the Remix menu. Also in the remix menu is a "inspect" tab that lets you see creatures' personalities and skills given an entity ID.
